           <p>The school Mountain Bike Club is a recently new addition to the school's range of summer sports. Lead by teachers, Shane Mann and Lee Macri, it
            has been a hit for boys of all ages and skill levels. From starting as a group of boys hanging out at the school bike track it went on to Wednesdays
            at the local bike park; Rivenrock. It slowly grew as more people joined and became a full sport. A custom trailer was built to accommodate around
            20 members of the club today. It isn't just Rivenrock either. In weekends keen boys came on optional school trips to Arapuke and other trail centres.
            Our biggest event so far has been the Wainuiomata North Islands Enduro. There were no podiums from Rathkeale boys but it was a good day out. If you
            are looking to improve your fitness and your skills contact Mr Mann or Mr Macri or head over to the contact page <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
            Before doing this make sure you meet the requirements <a href="Requirements.html">here</a></p>
