        Seeing as mountain biking is now a fulltime sport we have compulsory trainings as with any other sport. 
        These trainings are pretty chill though and mainly consist of going for a ride with your mates. We train 
        on tuesday and thursday from after school to 4:30pm or if we are at Rivenrock we get back to school at 
        around 6:00pm. This means that you have to order a late dinner from the dining hall if you are a boarder.
